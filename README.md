<h1>About API documentation</h1> <br>
<ul>
  <li>Documenting APIs can be a little tedious so the idea is to make it interactive (even developers get bored.) </li>
<li>API doc is a specific type of documentation writing. TW nowaday transition towards API documentation, as it is not currently an offering in classic TW courses, be it in the US or say, France. Tech companies tend to hire developers who understand APIs but do not know... how to write (i.e structure doc and organize info).</li>
<li>API doc = writing for people who develop software HOWEVER other roles can be interesting in doc, notably marketing. API Documentation IS the interface.</li>
<li>Websites tend to be custom-built in that you pull the APIs you require, as opposed to using a ready-made CMS.</li>
  <h2>Focusing  
 on REST APIs</h2>
  APIs are about requests and responses from one computer to another (also cloud). Computers aren't intelligent, they need these little cogs (APIs) to actually be able to communicate.
  What developers want to know : 
  <ul>
    <li>How to make requests</li>
    <li>What comes back</li>
  </ul>
  Hence, the bulk of the documentation is NOT the programming language. In a sense, PL doesn't matter.
  <h2>Bottom line</h2>
  You're writing for developers: learn to use APIs like they do!
